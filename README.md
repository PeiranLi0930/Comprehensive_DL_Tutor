NOTE: This repo is currently being fixed and finished!
- I am now re-implementing all of the codes in Pytorch!
- In the future, this document will be transformed into an interactive e-book for easy searching and studying.
- Now that I am working on my own, if you are interested in ML/DL/CV, please email me and welcome to my workspace! (You can find my email 
on my Github Homepage)

# Deep Learning & Machine Learning Algorithms and Applications

## Introduction
To better express these concepts and bring the general public into the domains of Machine Learning and Deep Learning, 
I am creating and organizing this repository to display comprehensive facts and expertise in an approachable manner. 
To be honest, developing complete specialities is difficult and time intensive. 
As a result, if there is an error or something incorrect, I would appreciate all corrections and recommendations.

I'd want to thank all of my teachers and professors for their help and guidance during my education.

This program includes:
  - Machine Learning Specialization
  - Deep Learning Specialization 
  - Deep Learning in Computer Vision
  - The Collection of Relavant Papers
  - The Proofs of All Applied Axioms
  - All Codes Implemented by Tensorflow 2.x Currently

  

### Declarations:
- Feel free to share but DO NOT replicate, sell, or any commercial behavior
- Appreciate all instructors and professors who contribute to these contents
- All the contents have the permissions to share and propagate
